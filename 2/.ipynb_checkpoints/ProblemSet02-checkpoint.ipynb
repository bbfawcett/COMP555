Implement this strategy and use it to search for the best 10-base motif. (Note: this requires that you do one at least of the following, add an additional argument to the *ScanAndScoreMotif()*, create a global variable shared by both *BetterMedianStringMotifSearch()* and *ScanAndScoreMotif()*, or encapuslate *ScanAndScoreMotif()* as an inner function of *BetterMedianStringMotifSearch()*).

This simply ends the check when it is proven to not be optimized, but will not eliminate similarly incorrect checks from being assessed. The only way for it to be a true branch-and-bound method is if there were a \"pruning\" method to eliminate subsequently incorrect analyses, which this algorithm fails to do. My method adds a new argument to the ScanAndScoreMotif function, as the smallest hamming distance that has been seen until that point from BetterMedianStringMotifSearch, and if the net distance for the ScandAndScoreMotif for a particular motif exceeds that, the algorithm is pre-emptively aborted to save time from completing unnecessary computations."

However, this solution may not be best overall solution. *ContainedMotifSearch()* can still be used to speed up *MedianStringMotifSearch()* using the following approach: First, use ContainedMotifSearch() to first establish an initial upper-bound for the Hamming distance. Then, use it as an intitial setting of the minimum Hamming distance used in *MedianStringMotifSearch()*. Also, consider how the prefixes of candidate motifs can be used to determine if further extensions might possibly beat the *ContainedMotifSearch()* solution. This last change makes the algorithm truely \"branch-and-bound\" and requires that succesive *patterns* be generated using a different approach than the itertools product used in *MedianStringMotifSearch()*.\n",
